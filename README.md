# dom-data-extractor

A collection of automation projects starting with a Chrome extension for DOM data extraction. Built for web automation, testing, and data extraction experiments. Includes Chrome extension and automation tools for web scraping, DOM analysis, and interactive element detection. Features XPath generation, node data extraction, and comprehensive debugging tools for web automation projects.

## Current Projects

### Chrome Extension - Node Data Printer

A minimal Chrome extension that prints node data for interactive elements, similar to the nanobrowser extension.

#### Features

- Prints node data for all interactive elements (`a`, `button`, `input`, `select`, `textarea`, `label`)
- Generates XPath for each element
- Checks element visibility
- Extracts attributes, values, and other relevant properties
- Works on all websites
- Automatically runs when page loads

#### Installation

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `chrome-extension-node-data` folder
5. The extension will be installed and active

#### Usage

1. Navigate to any website
2. Open the browser's Developer Tools (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect)
3. Go to the Console tab
4. The extension will automatically print node data when the page loads

#### Output Format

The extension prints two types of data:

##### Interactive Node Data
```
=== INTERACTIVE NODEDATA ===
Interactive element (input): {tagName: 'input', attributes: {...}, xpath: '...', children: Array(0), isVisible: false}
=== END INTERACTIVE NODEDATA ===
```

##### All Node Data
```
=== ALL NODEDATA ===
Node 0: {tagName: 'div', attributes: {...}, xpath: '...', children: Array(0), isVisible: false}
Node 1: {tagName: 'div', attributes: {...}, xpath: '...', children: Array(0), isVisible: true, ...}
=== END ALL NODEDATA ===
```

#### Node Data Structure

Each node contains:
- `tagName`: The HTML tag name
- `attributes`: Object containing all element attributes
- `xpath`: XPath expression to locate the element
- `children`: Array of child elements (empty for this minimal version)
- `isVisible`: Boolean indicating if element is visible
- `textContent`: Text content if available
- `value`: Value for input elements
- `href`: Href for anchor elements
- `placeholder`: Placeholder text for input elements
- `type`: Input type for input elements

#### Files

- `manifest.json`: Extension configuration
- `content.js`: Main script that runs on web pages
- `background.js`: Background service worker
- `debug.js`: Debugging script for testing
- `test.html`: Test page with various interactive elements
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`: Comprehensive troubleshooting guide

## Current Technology Stack

- **JavaScript**: Chrome extension development
- **HTML/CSS**: Test pages and UI components
- **Chrome Extension APIs**: Manifest V3, content scripts, background workers
- **Web Technologies**: DOM manipulation, XPath generation
